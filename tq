    script.js
    After pressing gridsize button if one does not enter a value, prompt returns null and program cannot create a matrix.
    To solve this i added if condiiton to default
    If matrix size is greater than 80, this may create slowing problems and to prevent this i created if condition to set a maximum.
    style.css
    Added margin, height and width to the button to make it look nicer.

    index.html
    it's the same.
    style.css
    tranferred features from body to the main class. Which now contains the container class.
    script.js
    Created maindiv and gave it main class. I wanted to create this class so that it holds all the container divs
    and i would be able to delete the children of it freely and add later at will.

    style.css
    I wanted to change the position of the grid and finally thought of using the html with display features to do that.
    script.js
    I tried to create a main container div for all of the containers out there so i can use flexbox features on it. Could not do it for some reason, then thought of doing it with html.

    script.js
    mouseover now changes the div's background color to black.
    style.css
    tried to do the background color change with defining a css property for a new class. Then adding this class to the grids which the mouse has entered.
    Could not do it because i was using the wrong constant.

    script.js
    I wanted to insert multiple grid constants inside each container. And tried to do that by using for loop in arrow function, it did not work.
    Then i saw that i could do the same thing with multiple lines of divList.forEach expression. Used a for loop to tidy it up
